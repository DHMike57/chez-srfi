# Introduction

SRFI Package for Chez Scheme of Arch Linux. Prebuilt Packages can be downloaded at [release](https://github.com/shih-liang/chez-srfi/releases).

This is a minor modification of the SRFI collection available at
https://github.com/arcfide/chez-srfi (itself derived from
https://launchpad.net/scheme-libraries).  The modifications are aimed
at improving the integration with Chez Scheme's interactive
environment.

See srfi/README for the original description.
